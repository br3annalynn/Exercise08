I never thought that it'd be easy.
Cause we both so distant now.
And the walls are closing in on us.
And we're wondering how.
No one has a solid answer.
But just walking in the dark.
And you can see the look on my face.
It just tears me apart.


So we fight (so we fight) through the hurt (through the hurt).
And we cry and cry and cry and cry.
And we live (and we live) and we learn (and we learn).
And we try and try and try and try.


So it's up to you and it's up to me.
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth.
Down to Earth, down to Earth.
On our way back down to Earth.
Back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth.
Back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth, back down to Earth.

Momma you were always somewhere.
And daddy I live out of town.
So tell me how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best.
So tell me why am I in tears?
(Whoa) So far away, and now I just need you here.



We fell so far away from where we used to be.
Now we're standing and where do we go.
When there's no road to get to your heart.
Let's start over again.

They look so small from up here.
Cause we're bigger, our love's bigger.
I'm bigger and you're bigger.

Whoa, remember when my heart was young.
It was still bigger than me (still bigger than me).
Is that the reason that you stayed.
Most would've got rid of me.
Now the bullies in the school yard.
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us.
Because we ain't push-overs, no more baby.

She woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks.
She made my heart pound, it skipped a beat when I see her in the street and.
At school on the playground but I really wanna see her on the weekend.
She knows she got me dazing cause she was so amazing.
And now my heart is breaking but I just keep on saying..

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place.).

Now Romeo and Juliet,
Bet they never felt the way we felt.
Bonnie and Clyde,
Never had to hide like we do, we do.
You and I both know it can't work,
It's all fun and games,
'Til someone gets hurt,
And I don't, I won't let that be you.

Now you don't wanna let go,
And I don't wanna let you know.
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but,
We're tripping in our hearts and,
It's reckless and clumsy,
Cause I know you can't love me, hey.

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can do.
To fight with time and space,
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you.

See like Adam and Eve,
Tragedy was our destiny,
Like Sonny and Cher,
I don't care, I've got you baby.
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber,
Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but,
We are both too foolish to stop.

Now you don't wanna let go,
And I don't wanna let you know.
That there might be something real between us two, who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but,

And I know you can't love me, hey.

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can do,
To fight with time and space,
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you.

See like just because this cold, cruel world.
Saying we can't be,
Baby, we both have the right to disagree,
And I ain't with it.
And I don't wanna be so old and gray,
Reminiscing about these better days,
But convention's telling us to let go.
So we'll never know.

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
Cause everything we did,
And everything we have is stuck in the moment.
(Yeah oh no no no).

I wish we had another time,
I wish we had another place,
But everything we have is stuck in the moment,
And there's nothing my heart can do (nothing my heart can do).
To fight with time and space (and space).
I'm still stuck in the moment with you.

(Never say never).
See I never thought that I could walk through fire.
I never thought that I could take the burn.
I never had the strength to take it higher.
Until I reached the point of no return.

And there's just no turning back.
When your heart's under attack.
Gonna give everything I have.
It's my destiny.

I will never say never! (I will fight).
I will fight till forever! (make it right).
Whenever you knock me down.

And I'm fast enough to run across the sea.

And there's just no turning back.
When your heart's under attack.
Gonna give everything I have.
'cause this is my destiny.

I will never say never! (I will fight).
I will fight till forever! (make it right).
Whenever you knock me down.

Now he's bigger than me.
Taller than me.
And he's older than me.
And stronger than me.
And his arms a little bit longer than me.
But he ain't on a JB song with me!.

I be trying a chill.
They be trying to sour the thrill.
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will.

Like Luke with the force, when push comes to shove.
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood.

I gotta be the best, and yes.
We're the flyest.
Like David and Goliath.
I conquered the giant.
So now I got the world in my hand.
I was born from two stars.
So the moon's where I land (I'm gone!).

I will never say never! (I will fight).
I will fight till forever! (make it right).
Whenever you knock me down.
I will not stay on the ground.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Pick it up.
Pick it up, up, up.
And never say never.

I will never say never! (I will fight).
I will fight till forever! (make it right).
Whenever you knock me down.

Used to tell me, "Sky's the limit", now the sky's our point of view (view).
Man now we stepping out like, "Whoa" (Oh God).
Cameras point and shoot (shoot).
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you.
You, you the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered with,
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side,
It's green where you water it.
